# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on health data.  
It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and a Streamlit web UI.

## 📁 Project Structure
- **data/** → contains cleaned datasets  
- **notebooks/** → step-by-step analysis and model training  
- **models/** → trained ML models saved as `.pkl`  
- **results/** → output charts, confusion matrices, evaluation reports  
- **ui/** → Streamlit web app for predictions  
- **deployment/** → ngrok setup for live deployment

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run ui/app.py
